# NetDrive

A software tool to access data on physical drive over the network.

This project is built using [python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.7.6

## Running the software

The software has not reached completion, but the proof of concept is ready.

**You need to have python 3 installed**

Step 1 : Clone the repository and fire up two command prompts and navigate to `%PATH%/src/services`.

Step 2 : In the one of the command prompts, run `py serverhub.py` and then wait to choose a drive or directory. Then the server is initialized

Step 3 : In the other command prompt, run `py clienthub.py`

That's it you can run the software now. Again this is just a prototype, still under development.
